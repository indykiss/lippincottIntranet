 Wtf am I doing
 Using my limited knowledge in JS and node to build hello world widget 

 Steps so far- I've tried and failed to install the program. Fun. But lodash installed just fine so idk wtf is going on there. 
 I'm guessing, possibily incorrectly that I'm failing because I'm missing Xcode or homebrew or whatever. Maybe I should ask for xcode. 
 I'm literally an idiot. To get terminal to play in JS, I need to > node
 That's it. Then we're in JS.

 I need to create a local directory before installing. Duh. Ok, need to do that. 
 Where I am. I created the local directory, and navigated to it with cd (hello_world_widget), then ran the code to get it to install.
 The local directory has the credentials.json that's not working, hence the general unhappiness.
 Essentially the code is: 
  cd desktop/
  cd hello_world_widget
  npm install --save @igloosoftware/ig-deploy
    // for now, we're just ignoring the use uuid module instead issue
  node deploy.js
    // should be done here, but doesn't work
